            "### Potential Bugs or Security Issues:\n",
            "1. **Stack Overflow**: Recursive functions can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too high. For large values of `n`, this function may exceed the maximum recursion depth and raise a `RecursionError`.\n",

            "### Code Structure and Design Patterns:\n",
            "1. **Recursion**: Recursion is a common technique for factorial calculation, but it may not be the most efficient approach for large values of `n` due to the overhead of function calls.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Security: \n",
            "   - It's important to ensure that the `active` column is properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. Consider using parameterized queries or ORM libraries to handle input sanitization.\n",

            "2. Performance:\n",
            "   - If the `active` column is frequently used for filtering in queries, you may want to consider adding an index on the `active` column to improve query performance, especially if the `users` table is large.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Maintainability:\n",
            "   - Using `SELECT *` can be problematic for maintainability, especially if the schema of the `users` table changes in the future. It's better to explicitly list the columns you need in the query to avoid unexpected behavior when the table structure changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's an improved version of the query considering the above points:\n",
            "\n",

            "WHERE active = 1;\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "In this improved version:\n",
            "- We explicitly list the columns `id`, `username`, and `email` instead of using `SELECT *`, which makes the query more maintainable.\n",
            "- We assume that `id`, `username`, and `email` are the relevant columns needed for the query. Adjust this list based on the actual requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "For test coverage, ensure that this query is included in your unit tests, especially if it's a critical part of your application. Also, consider testing edge cases such as when there are no active users in the database.\n",
            "\n",

            "Response: Using AI for employee performance monitoring raises several ethical concerns:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Fairness and Bias**: AI algorithms may inadvertently introduce bias into performance evaluations if the training data reflects historical biases. This could lead to discrimination against certain groups of employees.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Transparency and Explainability**: Employees may not understand how AI algorithms are being used to monitor their performance, leading to a lack of transparency and potential distrust in the system.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Privacy and Data Protection**: Monitoring employees using AI may infringe on their privacy rights, especially if sensitive personal data is being collected without their explicit consent.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Societal Impact**: Constant monitoring through AI could create a culture of surveillance within the organization, impacting employee well-being, morale, and creativity.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Long-term Consequences**: Over-reliance on AI for performance monitoring could dehumanize the workplace, reduce autonomy, and stifle innovation and personal growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "To address these concerns and ensure ethical use of AI for employee performance monitoring, consider the following mitigation strategies:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Fairness and Bias**: Regularly audit the AI algorithms for biases and ensure diverse representation in the training data. Utilize fairness-aware techniques to mitigate bias in the algorithms.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Transparency and Explainability**: Provide clear explanations to employees about how AI is being used for performance monitoring. Implement mechanisms for employees to challenge or question the decisions made by AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Privacy and Data Protection**: Implement strong data protection measures, such as anonymization of data, encryption, and access controls. Obtain explicit consent from employees before collecting any personal data.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Societal Impact**: Foster a culture of trust and transparency within the organization regarding the use of AI for performance monitoring. Encourage open communication and feedback mechanisms between employees and management.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Long-term Consequences**: Balance the use of AI with human oversight and intervention. Ensure that AI is used as a tool to support decision-making rather than replace human judgment entirely.\n",
            "\n",
            "Incorporating principles from ethical frameworks such as the IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in AI and Autonomous Systems or the ACM Code of Ethics can guide organizations in developing responsible AI practices for employee performance monitoring.\n",

There are risks of misidentification, tracking individuals without consent, and profiling based on sensitive characteristics.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Impacts on Stakeholders**: \n",
            "   - Individuals: Face surveillance can violate individuals' right to privacy and lead to unwarranted tracking and monitoring.\n",
            "   - Marginalized groups: Biases in facial recognition systems can disproportionately impact marginalized communities, leading to discrimination and further marginalization.\n",
            "   - Society: Proliferation of facial recognition can erode trust in public spaces and have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and assembly.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Relevant Frameworks**:\n",
            "   - **Fairness and Bias**: Concerns about bias in facial recognition systems have been well-documented, where certain demographics are misidentified more frequently. Frameworks like Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) can be applied to mitigate biases.\n",
            "   - **Privacy and Data Protection**: Principles from regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or privacy-by-design frameworks can guide the ethical use of facial recognition technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Mitigation Strategies**:\n",
            "   - Implement strict regulations on the use of facial recognition in public spaces, ensuring consent, transparency, and accountability.\n",
            "   - Conduct regular audits to check for biases and errors in the system.\n",
            "   - Provide clear avenues for individuals to opt-out of facial recognition technology in public areas.\n",
            "   - Engage with impacted communities and civil society organizations to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Balanced Perspectives**:\n",
            "   - Proponents argue that facial recognition can enhance public safety and security by aiding law enforcement in identifying suspects or missing persons.\n",
            "   - Critics raise concerns about the potential for misuse, abuse, and the erosion of civil liberties through constant surveillance.\n",
            "\n",
